-----------

The hydraulic pressure deviates from the hydraulic pressure set point calculated by the engine control system.

Cause
-----

- Hydraulic system leakage, or  
- Engine driven pump failure, or

SF Index Calibration in Limit.

Description
-----------

Automatic index calibration reached limit.

Cause
-----

- Fuel quality has changed more than allowed by the automatic adjustment.  
- Cylinder pressure sensor is failing.  
- Failure on fuel equipment, that leads to less injected fuel than ordered.  
- If WIF (Water In Fuel) is applied the water content may have changed.

Effect
------

- The engine load estimation is not fully correct, which may cause fuel index limiters to be incorrect.  
- Prise and Pcomp/Pscav set points might deviate from design values.  
- Cylinder oil feed rate might be incorrect.

Suggested actions
-----------------

Check:  
- That fuel quality is as expected.

Description
-----------

Average Pmax has exceeded Pmax alarm limit.

Cause
-----

Too high Maximum Pressure.

Effect
------

- Increased wear of cylinder liners  
- Risk of breakage of piston rings  
- Too high load on crosshead bearings.

Suggested actions
-----------------

Immediate Action:  
Reduce ""Pmax Offset All"" to lower average Pmax below alarm limit.  
Troubleshooting:  
1.Check that ""Estimated Engine Load"" (as shown on MOP) is correct by comparing with PMI  
equipment and/or torquemeter.  
If incorrect then utilize Fuel Quality feature for adjusting estimated engine load.  
2.Check that average ""Current Pcomp"" and ""Ordered Pcomp"" are equal (within tolerances).  
If necessary then carry out adjustments by changing ""Pcomp/Pscav Offset All"" manually or via Auto  
Tuning (Pcomp mean value).  
3.Check that average ""Current Pmax"" and ""Ordered Pmax"" are equal (within tolerances).  
If necessary then carry out adjustments by changing ""Pmax Offset All"" manually or via Auto Tuning  
(Pmax mean value).  
If unable to achieve correct Pcomp (in step 2) then Pscav might be too high. This could be due to  
severe ambient conditions or malfunctioning of exhaust gas bypass etc. Please do not use Auto  
Tuning functionality and keep ""Pmax Offset All"" reduced manually below alarm limit."

- SF injection valve leaking causing too large SF injection and blow back from combustion chamber, or  
- Window/Resume (if present) valve leaking causing SF flow from accumulator to SF channel, or  
- Blow off valve leaking.

Effect
------

- Dual fuel shutdown  
- Engine operation on fuel oil  
- Second fuel blocked  
  
WARNING!  
Leaking SF injection valve may cause blowback from combustion chamber to SF block, and risk of severe damage to SF components and cylinder cover!

Suggested actions
-----------------

RECOMMENDATION if leaking SF injection valve:  
- Cut-out fuel oil injection on this cylinder, or   
- Stop and exchange the damaged valve.  
  
DO NOT start dual fuel operation until this failure is located and repaired.  
  
DO NOT reset second fuel block before failure is located.  
  
Check:  
- Cylinder and second fuel pressure curves. Go to: 'Maintenance' -> 'Troubleshooting' -> 'Cyl. Events' or use SCSU scope to analyse logs located in MAD folder.  
- Window valve  
- Second fuel injection valve  
  
WARNING! (GI engines)  
If second fuel pressure curve is abnormal (injection starts early when WV is activated or pressure drop is higher than normal), do not attempt to restart dual fuel operation, before engine has been stopped and gas block troubleshooting is completed. Go to 'Maintenance' -> 'Troubleshooting' -> 'Gas Block'.  
  
Reference is made to circular letter or instruction manual showing pressure curves from typical failure situation."

Alarm ECUA-020125AM, ECUB-020125AM
==================================

Cylinder lubrication insufficient.

Description
-----------

Requested cylinder lubrication oil injection is greater than one full stroke per revolution on one or more units.

Cause
-----

The Cylinder Lubrication Oil Feed Rate needed is too high.   
  
- High operator defined feed rate demand (g/kWh). Cylinder feed rate adjusted to a high value at high engine load, or   
- High sulfur neutralization demand, due to abnormally high sulfur content in Fuel Oil or Fuel Mix, and/or   
- Cylinder lubrication oil used has a too low BN number to support sufficient neutralization.

Effect
------

The cylinder lubricator will be activated with the highest frequency possible, one per revolution.   
  
Under the current conditions the engine cannot maintain requested feed rate, risking excessive wear to the cylinders.

Suggested actions
-----------------

Check cylinder lubrication screen and verify that the cylinder lubrication oil settings are in accordance with recommendations.   
  
Decrease engine load to reduce the amount of cylinder oil needed.

Alarm ECUA-020154B06, ECUB-020154B06
====================================

Average Pmax above allowed value.

Description
-----------

Average Pmax has exceeded alarm limit.

Cause
-----

Too high Maximum Pressure.

Effect
------

- Increased wear of cylinder liners  
- Risk of breakage of piston rings  
- Too high load on crosshead bearings  
- The limiter ""Compression pressure"" may be activated.

Suggested actions
-----------------

Immediate Action:  
Reduce ""Pmax Offset All"" to lower average Pmax below alarm limit.  
Troubleshooting:  
1.Check that ""Estimated Engine Load"" (as shown on MOP) is correct by comparing with PMI  
equipment and/or torquemeter.  
If incorrect then utilize Fuel Quality feature for adjusting estimated engine load.  
2.Check that average ""Current Pcomp"" and ""Ordered Pcomp"" are equal (within tolerances).  
If necessary then carry out adjustments by changing ""Pcomp/Pscav Offset All"" manually or via Auto  
Tuning (Pcomp mean value).  
3.Check that average ""Current Pmax"" and ""Ordered Pmax"" are equal (within tolerances).  
If necessary then carry out adjustments by changing ""Pmax Offset All"" manually or via Auto Tuning  
(Pmax mean value).  
If unable to achieve correct Pcomp (in step 2) then Pscav might be too high. This could be due to  
severe ambient conditions or malfunctioning of exhaust gas bypass etc. Please do not use Auto  
Tuning functionality and keep ""Pmax Offset All"" reduced manually below alarm limit."

- Too high load on crosshead bearings.

Suggested actions
-----------------

Immediate Action:  
Reduce ""Pmax Offset"" on actual cylinder unit to lower Prise below alarm limit.  
Troubleshooting:  
1.Check that current Pcomp ""Deviation"" for the actual cylinder unit is within tolerances.  
If necessary then carry out adjustments by changing ""Pcomp/Pscav Offset"" on the actual cylinder unit  
manually or via Auto Tuning (Pcomp Deviation ->Pcomp).  
2.Check that current Pmax ""Deviation"" for the actual cylinder unit is within tolerances.  
If necessary then carry out adjustments by changing ""Pmax Offset"" for the actual cylinder unit  
manually or via Auto Tuning (Pmax Deviation ->Pmax).  
If unable to achieve correct Pcomp (in step 2) then please do not use Auto Tuning functionality and  
keep ""Pmax Offset"" reduced manually on actual cylinder unit below alarm limit."
